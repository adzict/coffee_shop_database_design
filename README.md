# Designing a Relational Database

## Project Goal

Streamline operations and enhance data infrastructure for a national expansion of a New York-based coffee shop chain by designing a centralized relational database system. The objective is to improve operational efficiencies, consolidate data from various sources (accounting software, suppliersâ€™ databases, POS systems, and spreadsheets), create and load database objects, and facilitate data-driven decision-making for executives. Additionally, subsets of required data will be exported and loaded into staging databases using different RDBMS to meet specific business partner needs.
